# Read-Eval-Print-Loop in C++ with cling and jupyter notebook / tutorial and advices

## About cling

> [Cling](https://github.com/root-project/cling) is an interactive C++ interpreter, built on top of Clang and LLVM compiler infrastructure. Cling realizes the read-eval-print loop (REPL) concept, in order to leverage rapid application development. Implemented as a small extension to LLVM and Clang, the interpreter reuses their strengths such as the praised concise and expressive compiler diagnostics.

It is based on the Root data analysis framework, and originates from the CERN. Cling is stil under heavy development and might fail (for example a segfault in your program will exit cling REPL). However it is quite useful, and used everyday at the CERN.

## About xeus cling

[Xeus cling](https://github.com/QuantStack/xeus-cling) is a Jupyter kernel for the C++ programming language based on cling.

Read the docs [here](https://xeus-cling.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Advices and Gotchas

The cling and xeus docs are good, but some informations are missing : see the page ["Advices and Gotchas when using cling and jupyter"](examples/notebooks/Advices_And_Gotchas.ipynb) for more details.
# Installation : how to test these examples on your computer

## Docker : quick test without modifying your machine
If you do not want to modify your machine, you can use the docker image provided inside `Docker_xeus`.

Refer to [Docker_xeus/Readme.md](Docker_xeus/Readme.md).

## Full installation on your machine
Refer to the instructions on the [xeus cling web page](https://github.com/QuantStack/xeus-cling)

## I don't want to install anything!

As mentioned before, these demos are [available online on mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pthom/Cling_Repl_Demo/master?filepath=examples%2Fnotebooks%2F)

# Intro to jupyter notebook

If you do not know jupyter notebook, take some time to familiarize yourself with the concept here:
* [Official site](http://jupyter.org/)
* [Try in online on the official site](http://jupyter.org/try)
* [Quick introduction to Jupyter Notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ952vChhuI) (youtube video, 7')
# How to navigate in these documents

*if you are reading this inside jupyter notebook*
* Click on the "Run" button at the top in order to run each cell (or type "Shift + Enter" in order to run it, and go to the next cell)
* For a better undertsanding, it is better to clear the outputs below: click on the "Kernel" menu, and select "Restart & Clear Output"


*If you are viewing a slideshow*
* navigate forward using the space bar
* also use the arrows in the bottom right corner
